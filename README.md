# Spanda

**The Autonomous Systems Platform** — *with a safety-first programming language at its core.*

*Build. Verify. Simulate. Deploy. Operate.*

Spanda is an autonomous systems platform centered on the **Spanda Language** (`.sd` files): typed robot programs, safety gates, hardware verification, cascading TOML configuration, simulation, replay, fleet operations, mission assurance, mission continuity, and **38** official packages.

**Spanda focuses on Readiness, Assurance, and Diagnosis for safety-critical autonomous systems.**

## Philosophy

Hardware is the body.  
Sensors are the senses.  
AI models are the mind.  
Actuators are the muscles.  
Spanda is the intelligent pulse that transforms perception, intent, and safety into action.

**Spanda** (*Pronounced **SPUN-duh** (/ˈspʌndə/)*) is a Sanskrit term meaning *the divine pulse* — the creative vibration of consciousness and energy that manifests as expansion and contraction in all entities, bridging stillness and movement within consciousness; and the first stir of awareness that creates and sustains the universe.

## What is Spanda?

Spanda is an **autonomous systems platform** built around the **Spanda Language** — a typed programming language where sensors, AI models, actuators, safety rules, and deployment targets are first-class concepts in source code.

You write a `robot` block with sensors, actuators, safety zones, and agents. The compiler enforces physical units, validates AI proposals before they reach hardware, and checks that your program fits the deployment target before you ship.

```spanda
robot SafePatrol {
  sensor lidar: Lidar;
  actuator wheels: DifferentialDrive;
  ai_model planner: LLM { provider: "mock"; model: "patrol"; }

  safety {
    max_speed = 0.5 m/s;
    stop_if lidar.nearest_distance < 0.5 m;
  }

  behavior patrol() {
    loop every 100ms {
      let proposal = planner.reason(prompt: "Plan motion", input: lidar.read());
      wheels.execute(safety.validate(proposal));
    }
  }
}
```

## Unified Entity Model

Everything managed by Spanda is represented as an **Entity** — robots, humans, devices, wearables, packages, providers, missions, facilities, and cloud services share one common architecture for identity, health, readiness, trust, relationships, and lifecycle.

```text
Entity
 ├── Health / Readiness / Trust
 ├── Capabilities & Relationships
 └── Verification (verify_entity)
         ↓
   Platform Services (Verify, Readiness, Device Pool, Fleet)
